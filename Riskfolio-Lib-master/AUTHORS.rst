* **Dany Cajas**

I'm a BSc in  Economic Engineering at Universidad Nacional de
Ingeniería and MA in Finance at Universidad del Pacífico. I am very interested
in quantitative finance. For more about me, you can visit:

- My blog `financioneroncios <https://financioneroncios.wordpress.com/>`_.
- My `linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dany-cajas/>`_.
- My `SSRN author page <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2931756>`_ where you can find all my working papers.
- Or write me to `dcajasn@gmail.com <dcajasn@gmail.com>`_.

I like to learn and apply my knowledge in practical applications; for this
reason, I started my blog to practice and share in my native language the things
that I've been learned until now. One topic that always have been very
interesting to me is portfolio optimization. However, I realized that
open-source libraries (python) are few (there are among one and four) and are
mainly focused on mean variance optimization, ignoring advances in other
convex risk measures (CVaR, MAD, Maximum Drawdown, etc.) and other
estimations techniques like robust estimates, Black Litterman and risk factors
models. For this reason, I developed Riskfolio-Lib, a well documented library
that will help students, academics and practitioners to apply mathematically
complex optimization models in their strategic asset allocation process.
